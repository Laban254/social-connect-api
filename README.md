# 🌐 Social Connect API

This project is a **social media backend** built using Flask, Flask-SocketIO, OAuth for authentication, and JWT for session management. It provides features for user authentication, profile management, content creation, interactions, and real-time notifications. The application is containerized using Docker for easy development and production deployments and uses **PostgreSQL** as the database.

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/social-connect-api.git
cd social-connect-api` 
```
### 2. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@db:5432/db_name
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=your-redirect-url
```
# OAuth credentials
```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret` 
```
Make sure you have PostgreSQL set up and the database created before running the application.

----------

## 🐳 Running with Docker Compose

To run the application and database using Docker Compose:

### 1. Build and Run the Docker Containers

```bash
docker-compose up --build` 
```
This command will start both the Flask application and the PostgreSQL database, as defined in the `docker-compose.yml`. The app will be running at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 2. Make and Apply Migrations

Once the containers are running, create migrations for the database models:

```bash
`docker-compose exec web flask db migrate` 
```
Then apply the migrations:

```bash
`docker-compose exec web flask db upgrade` 
```
This will ensure the database schema is up-to-date with your application models.
